- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @trisys3, a driven, passionate web developer from NJ, USA. I do work for companies, though I try to help the open source community when I can.

- ðŸŒ± I mostly do NodeJS development, along with React/Vue on the front-end. I also like Webpack. I love learning new things so I keep my ear to the ground.

- ðŸ“« You can reach me at (201) 787-5618 or sean_r_moran@msn.com.
